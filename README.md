# CXR-Triage-Scheduler
CV + RL radiology worklist triage: a chest X-ray model estimates urgency + uncertainty, then an RL agent learns a queue policy in a simulated department to reduce urgent-case turnaround time while preserving throughput and fairness vs FIFO and score-based baselines. Includes simulator, training/eval scripts.
